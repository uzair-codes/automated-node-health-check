# Automated Remote Node Health Check (Multi-Node)

A Bash script to automatically check the health of one or multiple remote Linux nodes.  
It performs ping reachability, logs in via SSH (using a PEM key), runs key system health commands, fetches the report locally, and saves it with a timestamp in a `./reports/` folder — with beautiful color-coded output for better readability.

## Features

✅ Interactive Mode – Run health check for a single node  
✅ Multi-Node Mode – Provide a file with multiple IPs  
✅ Color-Coded Output – Highlights UP/DOWN status and report headings  
✅ Detailed Health Checks – Uptime, CPU, memory, disk usage, and top processes  
✅ Local Logging – Saves timestamped reports in `./reports/` folder  
✅ Beginner-Friendly – Includes helper function and error messages for incorrect usage  



## 📦 Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure:

- You have SSH access to your remote nodes.
- You have a valid PEM key file (or SSH key pair).
- `bash`, `ssh`, `scp`, and `ping` are available on your system (default on Linux/macOS).
- For multiple nodes: You have a file (e.g., `nodes.txt`) containing one IP address per line.



## Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uzair-codes/Automated-Node-Health-Check.git
cd Automated-Node-Health-Check
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x nodeHealth.sh
```



## 🖥️ Usage

You can run the script in two modes:

### 🔹 1. Single Node Mode (Interactive)

```bash
./nodeHealth.sh
```

It will prompt you for:

* Node IP address
* Remote username (e.g., `ec2-user`, `ubuntu`)
* Path to PEM key file



### 🔹 2. Multi-Node Mode (From File)

Create a file with one IP per line, e.g.:

nodes.txt

```
192.168.1.10
192.168.1.11
192.168.1.12
```

Run the script with:

```bash
./nodeHealth.sh -f nodes.txt
```

The script will loop through each IP and generate individual health reports.

## 🗂️ Report Storage

All reports are automatically saved under `./reports/` with a timestamped filename:

```
reports/
├── health_report_192.168.1.10_20250920_094213.txt
├── health_report_192.168.1.11_20250920_094220.txt
└── health_report_192.168.1.12_20250920_094225.txt
```



## 🔧 Troubleshooting

* Permission denied (publickey):
  Ensure the correct PEM key path is provided and permissions are set:

  ```bash
  chmod 400 my-key.pem
  ```

* Script not executing:
  Make sure it has execute permission:

  ```bash
  chmod +x nodeHealth.sh
  ```

* File not found error for nodes file:
  Ensure the file exists and contains one IP per line.
